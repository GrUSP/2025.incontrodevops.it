Dal capire perché 'meno è meglio' quando si dimensionano le risorse, all’allineare i costi al modello di business (addio finti SaaS!), fino alla scoperta che l’infrastruttura da manuale è più dannosa che altro.

        Giunto ormai alla sua settima edizione la manifestazione ha al suo attivo oltre 240 tavoli da gioco dove chiunque potrà trovare emozioni, divertimento e, in fin dei conti, un’avventura.
        Vedremo come sia stato possibile riuscire a sviluppare una web application per le iscrizioni agli oltre 500 eventi in programma e far gestire più di 2000 posti gioco a disposizione di associazioni e sponsor, oltre alla creazione e gestione di una considerevole banca dati di giochi in continuo aggiornamento (10.000 giochi tra giochi da tavolo e giochi di ruolo).
        Il tutto in maniera serverless e altamente scalabile, con l'utilizzo di Google Cloud, microservizi in Quarkus e Firebase.
        L'applicazione sarà riuscita a reggere la fruizione delle ricerche in parallelo?
        Sarà riuscita a scalare opportunamente?

        Pur essendo piuttosto giovane, il primo episodio è dell'Ottobre 2024, ha già avuto come ospiti personaggi come Patrick Debois e Kris Buytaert (tra i fondatori del movimento DevOps), Luke Kanies e Adam Jacob (creatori rispettivamente di Puppet e Chef), Manuel Pais (autore di Team Topologies) e molti altri.
        In questa presentazione facciamo una sintesi dei principi e concetti più interessanti espressi dagli ospiti di Abnormal DevOps Iterations. Un compendio, denso, brillante e profondo, di opinioni, riflessioni e pensieri sul mondo IT e DevOps da parte di protagonisti illuminati e attori della comunità DevOps. "

        talk_title: "To cloud, or not to cloud?"
        talk_description: "Traditionally, the cloud has been the go-to choice for applications demanding elasticity, scalability, and cost-efficiency.
        However, what if you could achieve these benefits without the complexities of cloud infrastructure?
        Kamal aims to democratize cloud-like deployment experiences. You can effortlessly deploy web applications on various platforms, from budget-friendly cloud providers like Digital Ocean, Hetzner, and OVH to self-managed bare-metal servers."

        talk_title: "Practical introduction to OpenTelemetry tracing"
        talk_description: "Tracking a request’s flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind.
      Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible.
      In this talk, I’ll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture."

        talk_description: "Have you ever wondered how Kubernetes can make deploying AI models easier? Or why has Ray become the go-to tool for scaling AI across clusters? In this talk, we’ll dig into the how, why, and what of running AI models on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with Ray, perfect for devs, DevOps, and anyone pumped about AI and ML.
        We’ll start from scratch, breaking down why Kubernetes is such a game-changer for AI, how Ray solves tough distributed processing challenges, and even how to set up ML pipelines that flow from CI to CT—all on Kubernetes. Plus, we’ll bring it all to life with a live demo, hosting a stable diffusion model right before your eyes!
        If you want to level up your AI model deployment, this session is your roadmap."

        item_type: talk
        track: *track_1
        talk_title: "Linux user namespaces: a blessing and a curse"
        talk_description: "Unprivileged Linux user namespaces is a rather controversial topic in the security community, Linux Kernel community and in software engineering in general. On one side it allows building unprivileged and sandboxed services and applications, which would otherwise require elevated privileges to successfully run and provide features to their users. Not granting privileges to such applications follows the least privilege principle and makes our systems more secure.
        On the other side, this mechanism has been repeatedly used in various vulnerabilities and exploits as a starting attack vector, multiplying the damage and impact of these exploits. And since it became so popular within the offensive industry, many Linux distributions and security guidances started recommending disabling this feature altogether.
        There is an ongoing debate whether unprivileged user namespaces provide more security or make the system more vulnerable. In this presentation we will review how user namespaces might help building sandboxed secure applications. But we will also show how a recently discovered Linux kernel bug turned into a security vulnerability just because user namespaces are available on the system. Finally, we will give recommendations on how to get the best of both worlds: allow well-behaved applications to utilize user namespaces for better security, while blocking the feature for potentially malicious users/code."

        talk_title: "Observing Python applications with OpenTelemetry"
        talk_description: "In this talk we'll see the options we have to add observability to Python applications with OpenTelemetry without touching our application code. In OpenTelemetry this is called autoinstrumentation or zero-code instrumentation.
        We'll see:
        <ul>
        - The OpenTelemetry operator, a Kubernetes operator to manage collection and inject autoinstrumentation to the pods
        - OpenTelemetry Python own autoinstrumentation solution based on the opentelemetry-instrument wrapper
        </ul>
        We'll evaluate the differences between the two solutions highlighting their strong and weak spots.
        We are also taking a look on the work done inside the OpenTelemetry project around GenAI. You may have noticed than a ton of GenAI code is written in Python :) "

        track: *track_1
        talk_title: "Fine grain access control for Kubernetes"
        talk_description: "Access control is a cornerstone of Kubernetes security, ensuring that only authorized users can view or modify cluster resources. While Kubernetes provides built-in mechanisms for access control, these are often too coarse-grained, making it challenging to define precise or, when necessary, customized permissions, such as the ability to define deny roles or set expirations on grants.
        In this talk, we will introduce the SpiceDB Kubernetes API Proxy, a powerful solution that integrates with SpiceDB—the leading open-source authorization system that embraces and extends the model used by Zanzibar, Google’s internal authorization solution. Attendees will learn how this proxy enables granular access control for Kubernetes APIs, offering enhanced security and flexibility for managing permissions in dynamic environments."
