        talk_title: "Distillato di Abnormal DevOps Iterations"
        talk_description: "Abnormal DevOps Iterations è un podcast dove vengono invitati ospiti e personalità del mondo IT e DevOps.
Pur essendo piuttosto giovane, il primo episodio è dell'Ottobre 2024, ha già avuto come ospiti personaggi come Patrick Debois e Kris Buytaert (tra i fondatori del movimento DevOps), Luke Kanies e Adam Jacob (creatori rispettivamente di Puppet e Chef), Manuel Pais (autore di Team Topologies) e molti altri.
In questa presentazione facciamo una sintesi dei principi e concetti più interessanti espressi dagli ospiti di Abnormal DevOps Iterations. Un compendio, denso, brillante e profondo, di opinioni, riflessioni e pensieri sul mondo IT e DevOps da parte di protagonisti illuminati e attori della comunità DevOps. "

        track: *track_1
        talk_title: "Leveraging PostgreSQL 17's JSONB for Enhanced Data Modeling and Performance"
        talk_description: "JSONB has been part of PostgreSQL since the ancient version 9.4. 

PostgreSQL 17's lates JSONB improvements provides a flexible and efficient way to store and query semi-structured data. 
Its indexing capabilities and optimized storage mechanisms make it ideal for handling large volumes of complex data, such as configuration settings, user profiles, and log data.

While NoSQL databases like MongoDB have gained popularity, recent breaking changes and performance issues have raised concerns about their long-term suitability as a primary data storage solution. 
PostgreSQL's mature ecosystem, strong community support and proven reliability offer a compelling alternative for handling complex data workloads.

The audience will learn about the JSONB functionalities available in PostgreSQL and the latest improvements making it a powerful allied to write applications at scale.

        item_type: keynote
        track: *track_1
        talk_title: "Linux user namespaces: a blessing and a curse"
        talk_description: "Unprivileged Linux user namespaces is a rather controversial topic in the security community, Linux Kernel community and in software engineering in general. On one side it allows building unprivileged and sandboxed services and applications, which would otherwise require elevated privileges to successfully run and provide features to their users. Not granting privileges to such applications follows the least privilege principle and makes our systems more secure.

On the other side, this mechanism has been repeatedly used in various vulnerabilities and exploits as a starting attack vector, multiplying the damage and impact of these exploits. And since it became so popular within the offensive industry, many Linux distributions and security guidances started recommending disabling this feature altogether.

There is an ongoing debate whether unprivileged user namespaces provide more security or make the system more vulnerable. In this presentation we will review how user namespaces might help building sandboxed secure applications. But we will also show how a recently discovered Linux kernel bug turned into a security vulnerability just because user namespaces are available on the system. Finally, we will give recommendations on how to get the best of both worlds: allow well-behaved applications to utilize user namespaces for better security, while blocking the feature for potentially malicious users/code."

        track: *track_1
        talk_title: "Observing Python applications with OpenTelemetry"
        talk_description: "In this talk we'll see the options we have to add observability to Python applications with OpenTelemetry without touching our application code. In OpenTelemetry this is called autoinstrumentation or zero-code instrumentation.
We'll see:
- The OpenTelemetry operator, a Kubernetes operator to manage collection and inject autoinstrumentation to the pods
 - OpenTelemetry Python own autoinstrumentation solution based on the opentelemetry-instrument wrapper

We'll evaluate the differences between the two solutions highlighting their strong and weak spots.

We are also taking a look on the work done inside the OpenTelemetry project around GenAI. You may have noticed than a ton of GenAI code is written in Python :) "
