        talk_description: "Tracking a request’s flow across different components in distributed systems is essential. With the rise of microservices, their importance has risen to critical levels. Some proprietary tools for tracking have been used already: Jaeger and Zipkin naturally come to mind.
      Observability is built on three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing. OpenTelemetry is a joint effort to bring an open standard to them. Jaeger and Zipkin joined the effort so that they are now OpenTelemetry compatible.
      In this talk, I’ll describe the above in more detail and showcase a (simple) use case to demo how you could benefit from OpenTelemetry in your distributed architecture."

        talk_title: "Linux user namespaces: a blessing and a curse"
        talk_description: "Unprivileged Linux user namespaces is a rather controversial topic in the security community, Linux Kernel community and in software engineering in general. On one side it allows building unprivileged and sandboxed services and applications, which would otherwise require elevated privileges to successfully run and provide features to their users. Not granting privileges to such applications follows the least privilege principle and makes our systems more secure.
        On the other side, this mechanism has been repeatedly used in various vulnerabilities and exploits as a starting attack vector, multiplying the damage and impact of these exploits. And since it became so popular within the offensive industry, many Linux distributions and security guidances started recommending disabling this feature altogether.
        There is an ongoing debate whether unprivileged user namespaces provide more security or make the system more vulnerable. In this presentation we will review how user namespaces might help building sandboxed secure applications. But we will also show how a recently discovered Linux kernel bug turned into a security vulnerability just because user namespaces are available on the system. Finally, we will give recommendations on how to get the best of both worlds: allow well-behaved applications to utilize user namespaces for better security, while blocking the feature for potentially malicious users/code."

        talk_description: "In this talk we'll see the options we have to add observability to Python applications with OpenTelemetry without touching our application code. In OpenTelemetry this is called autoinstrumentation or zero-code instrumentation.
        We'll see:
        <ul>
        - The OpenTelemetry operator, a Kubernetes operator to manage collection and inject autoinstrumentation to the pods
        - OpenTelemetry Python own autoinstrumentation solution based on the opentelemetry-instrument wrapper
        </ul>
        We'll evaluate the differences between the two solutions highlighting their strong and weak spots.
        We are also taking a look on the work done inside the OpenTelemetry project around GenAI. You may have noticed than a ton of GenAI code is written in Python :) "
